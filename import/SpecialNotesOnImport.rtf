1. In BLCA, sample P14N.EU is labeled as CIS, presumably carcinoma in situ. It\'92s label is ambiguous, as the suffix \'93N\'94 generally indicates a normal sample. However, given that it is CIS, we have treated it as a tumor for the purposes of our analysis. We have also removed the P14 pair from any paired analysis.}
